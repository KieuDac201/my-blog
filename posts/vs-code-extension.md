Better comments is an extension that can help you create “Human friendly” comments in your code. It is an example of how a small idea can help you increase your productivity and improve the quality of your work. Using this extension you can categorize your annotations into queries, alerts, Highlights and To do’s. This extension also gives you an option for comment style other than default comment style that can be selected through settings. Personally, It helps me spot important To Do's that might get skipped from my agenda.

blox is another extension that can help you improve your productivity as it lets you drop code snippets with a single click. It’s aimed at fast tracking the developer workflow through the ease of adding pre-built UI components without leaving your VS code window. blox is supported by React, Angular, Vue and TailwindCSS.

## Stepsize:

Stepsize helps you bookmark your code, report technical debt and code to refactor. If you find an issue while coding that needs to be fixed but you don’t have enough time to do it, In that case you can bookmark code and create TODOs straight in your IDE without compromising on your work or affecting your workflow. Stepsize also allows you to collaborate with your teammates on maintenance and refactoring work.

## SonarLint:

Sonarlint is another extension for devs that lets you fix coding issues even before they exist. For example, just like spell checker, SonarLint points out bugs and Security Vulnerabilities as you write your code, with guidance on how you can fix them before the code is even committed. SonarLint in VS Code supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, HTML & PHP code.
